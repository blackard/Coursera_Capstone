Capstone Project for Coursera Applied Data Science Professional Certificate

This project contains the content created as part of my Coursera Capstone project to complete the Applied Data Science Professional Certificate.

The Jupyter Notebook containing code and results are stored as Blob data at [Selecting Neighborhoods When Moving to Austin TX](https://github.com/blackard/Coursera_Capstone/blob/master/Selecting%20Neighborhoods%20When%20Moving%20to%20Austin%2C%20TX.ipynb).  The Notebook can be examined in the Jupyter Notebook Viewer using the link [Notebook Viewer - Selecting Neghborhoods When Moving to Austin TX](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/blackard/Coursera_Capstone/blob/master/Selecting%20Neighborhoods%20When%20Moving%20to%20Austin%2C%20TX.ipynb).
